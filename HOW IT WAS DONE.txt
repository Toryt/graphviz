HOW IT WAS DONE

graphviz repo differs from tar

If you are building from Mercurial sources, then you must have recent versions of "libtool", "automake", and "autoconf".
you need to run ./autogen.sh to get things to the same state

Abbreviated Build Instrctions

but that requires some tools that are not on MacOS X

KOSTUNRIX:graphviz jand$ which libtool
/usr/bin/libtool
KOSTUNRIX:graphviz jand$ which automake
KOSTUNRIX:graphviz jand$ which autoconf
brew install automake # installs automake and autoconf

Then ./autogen.sh fails

brew install pkgconfig
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew install m4 # mac os x version is really old

brew install libtool

In order to prevent conflicts with Apple's own libtool we have prepended a "g"
so, you have instead: glibtool and glibtoolize.

KOSTUNRIX:graphviz jand$ glibtool --version
glibtool (GNU libtool) 2.4.6

And indeed: output says

_g_libtool!

How smart they are.

But now it works!
